1. Project Overview

The Office Management & Employee Task Handling System is a Python-based console application designed to simulate real-world organizational workflows. Employees receive tasks and instructions dynamically based on their roles. The project demonstrates practical use of object-oriented programming (OOP), conditional logic, and automated task handling.

3. Problem Statement

Traditional office operations often rely on manual instructions, handwritten reports, or face-to-face task delegation. This results in:

Unclear responsibilities

Inefficient task management

Lack of timely performance tracking

Difficulty in monitoring deadlines


This project addresses these challenges by creating a structured, automated system that assigns tasks, calculates incentives, and provides deadlines instantly.
